## Private keys
The Api used needs a key not included here.

Create a new `.env` with the key:

```
API_KEY=<your-key-here>

```



## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
